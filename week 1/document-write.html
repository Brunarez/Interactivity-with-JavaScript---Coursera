  <!-- document.write is not the best way to do it. Because sometimes if you're misusing it you can overwrite other things that exist. So document.write is something you just want to use when you're beginning and you don't know some of the more complex methods. 
  It appears exactly the same as normal html h1 tag-->
  <script>
    document.write("<h1> Hello World</h1>")
  </script>
  
</body>
